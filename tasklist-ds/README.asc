Overview
========

Example for the "Karaf Tutorial 10 - Declarative services and JPA" 

In this tutorial we reimplement the TaskService example using declarative services (DS).
Aries JPA 2 is used to bring jpa support to DS. The eclipsesource jax-rs-connector is used to
export an annotated class as REST servoce.

The tutorial skips details about DataSource creation and the model bundle as they are exactly the
same as in the blueprint example. 

Structure

[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================
| Module             | Description  
| model              | Service interface and model classes shared between persistence and ui
| persistence        | Full persistence implementation using JPA and hibernate
| ui                 | Servlet based UI. Uses TaskService and publishes a servlet

Make sure to use JDK 8.
mvn clean install

Installation
============

Make sure you use JDK 8.
Download and extract Karaf 4.0.0.

Start karaf and execute the commands below

# Install H2 DB annd create DataSource tasklist
....
cat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cschneider/Karaf-Tutorial/master/tasklist-blueprint-cdi/org.ops4j.datasource-tasklist.cfg | tac -f etc/org.ops4j.datasource-tasklist.cfg

Test
====

Open the url below in your browser to view all known tasks:
http://localhost:8181/tasklist

View the tasks as a rest resource
http://localhost:8181/services/tasklist

Create Task2 using the rest service
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":2,"title":"Task2"}'  http://localhost:8181/services/tasklist

Retrieve Task2
curl -i http://localhost:8181/cxf/tasklistRest/2
