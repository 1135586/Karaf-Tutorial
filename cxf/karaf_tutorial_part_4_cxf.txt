{excerpt}

h2. Installing Karaf and preparing for CXF

We start with a fresh Karaf 2.2.4 and tune it to be able to run CXF like described in Dan Kulp´s Blog:
See http://www.dankulp.com/blog/2011/11/apache-cxf-in-osgi/

* Unpack Karaf 2.2.4 from http://karaf.apache.org/index/community/download.html
* Download https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/branches/karaf-2.2.x/assemblies/apache-karaf/src/main/filtered-resources/etc/jre.properties.cxf
  and save as etc/jre.properties
* Run Karaf

h2. Installing CXF

In Karaf Console run

> features:addurl mvn:org.apache.cxf.karaf/apache-cxf/2.5.0/xml/features
> features:install http
> features:install cxf

h2. The PersonService project

As a practical example we want to create a rest service that manages persons. So we have a Person object with JAXB annotations and a PersonService class with JAX-RS annotations.
